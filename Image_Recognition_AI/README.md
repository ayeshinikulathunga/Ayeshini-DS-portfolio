#Image Recognition AI with MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Transfer Learning

This project contains a comprehensive deep learning project 
focused on image recognition. 
The code demonstrates the full machine learning workflow, 
from data preprocessing to model evaluation, across three different datasets MNIST, CIFAR-10, Cats Vs. Dogs dataset. 
It serves as a practical guide for building and training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
and utilizing transfer learning with a pre-trained model, MobileNetV2.

Features
1. MNIST Classification: A CNN model is built from scratch to classify handwritten digits.
2. CIFAR-10 Model: An enhanced CNN with data augmentation, Batch Normalization, and Dropout layers is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
3. Transfer Learning: The MobileNetV2 model is used for a binary classification task on a Cats vs Dogs dataset, showcasing the power of fine-tuning pre-trained networks.
4. Model Evaluation: The project includes detailed evaluation metrics, including a confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve, along with comparative performance charts.
5. Live Prediction: The final part of the code demonstrates how to load a saved model and make a prediction on a new image.

Potential next steps 
1. Web Application: Deploy the model in a web application using frameworks like Flask or Streamlit to create an interactive demo.
2. Explore Other Architectures: Experiment with different pre-trained models like ResNet or Vision Transformers (ViT) to compare performance.
3. Model Optimization: Implement techniques like model quantization to optimize the model for use on edge devices.
